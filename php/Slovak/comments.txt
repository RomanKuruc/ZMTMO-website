Robert|Lewandowski|Bloody angles, the symmetry. Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me. My mouth is a gun I can shoot, I can show you the truth and I don't need a reason to lie to you. No pun intended, no punishment, If I offended you, you needed it, ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time, If you don't have a weapon you can't have mine
